# Coding Challange: Multiplayer Snake

## Game rule ideas:

We want to promote getting longer and killing other snakes. Which rule should we use to promote this?

- when you create a loop, you kill every enemy inside it
- your final score is the highest length achieved
- your final score is the amount of kills achieved
- snakes are ranked by how long they have survived. But there is a maximum game length and the snake length is used
- you are able to accelerate by going straight
- you can discard parts of your body to gain speed
- you have to eat an apple every x game steps, or your snake will die from hunger
- faster movement for longer snakes
